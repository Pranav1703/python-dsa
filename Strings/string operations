#checking_for_substrings
for example substrings in "ABC" are "","A","AB","BC","ABC"

s1 = "geeksforgeeks"
s2 = "geeks"

print(s2 in s1) #True
print(s2 not in s1) #False

#concatenation
s1 = "geeks"
s2 = "for"
s3 = s1 + s2

s4 = "welcome to " + s1 + s2

print(s3)

#position_of_substring        
s1 = "geeksforgeeks"
s2 = "geeks"

print(s1.index(s2))    #first index of the substrings
print(s1.rindex(s2))        # index of the substring from right
print(s1.index(s2,1,13))    # start and end index of the string.searchs the given the substring i.e from start to end index passes in the function,
                              last argument is excusive.it is len(str)+1

output:
